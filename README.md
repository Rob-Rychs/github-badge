# Github Badge

GitHub badge is a simple embeddable badge showing your GitHub stats like the number of public repositories, number of followers, favorite languages etc.
It runs on Google App Engine with a memcached backup at http://githubbadge.appspot.com. If you like this and use it too much, we may exceed our quota =D
