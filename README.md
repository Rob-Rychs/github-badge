# Github Badge

GitHub badge is a simple embeddable badge showing your [GitHub](http://github.com/) stats like the number of public repositories, number of followers, favorite languages etc.
It runs on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) with a memcached backup at http://githubbadge.appspot.com/. If you like this and use it too much, we may exceed our quota :-)
